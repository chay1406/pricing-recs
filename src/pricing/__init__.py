"""Top-level package for pricing recommendation modules.

This package provides connectors for data I/O, feature engineering
utilities, model definitions, inference logic, MLOps helpers, and other
utilities.  The skeleton here contains minimal class definitions to
establish the structure of the project.  Concrete implementations
should be added in subsequent development phases.
